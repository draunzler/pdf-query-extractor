# pdf-query-extractor

This an automation python code that helps to specify keywords and then print the information specied under it and save it in a csv file. It is efficiently useful when values of similar field are needed to be extracted from a bulk amount of PDFs (let's say 5000).

Let's take an example where the values of `Shipping Address` and `Order no.` needs to be stored of 5000 similar invoice PDFs and collected in a single csv file. Doing that manually would need a lot of time. Instead if we gather all the invoice PDFs in a single directory, use the automation code, the same amount of work can be done in minutes.

Bundle the code as a standalone application (.exe) file by using `pyinstaller`
